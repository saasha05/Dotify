# Dotify by Saasha Mor

This is a proof of concept for an app where people can listen to music on the cloud.
This app has the following features
- Click on song in list to change song in mini player
- Shuffle song list by clicking the "Shuffle Button"
- Click on the mini player on the bottom to display full view of song
- Change user name in full view
- Click the previous or next buttons to "Skip song"
- Click the play button to increase number of plays

Dotify now uses Fragments and the wonders of the Activity Lifecycle to make it run smoothly!

## Doing me a confuse
- How do I get the miniPlayer to only show up when the songListFragment is displayed?
- When app is rotated how do I recreate all the fragments like before?
- How does the activity know which was the last fragment being displayed?
- When it displays it does the information come from the activity i.e. is it completely recreated
or does it come from the fragments saved instance state?
