This is a proof of concept for an app where people can listen to music on the cloud.
This app has the following features

- Shuffle song list by clicking the "Shuffle Button"
- Click on the mini player on the bottom to display full view of song
- Change user name in full view
- Click the previous or next buttons to "Skip song"
- Click the play button to increase number of plays
- Long press image to change all text colors
